# FizzBuzz
FizzBuzz is a program that will print numbers 1-100, each on a new line, but with an interesting twist. Any number that is divisible by 3 won't be printed, but instead the word "Fizz" will be printed, and similarly for any number that is divisible by 5 the word "Buzz" will be printed. Any time a number is divisible by both 3 and 5 the word "FizzBuzz" will be printed.
